## 🌟 Introduction
This repository offers a **comprehensive and up-to-date collection** of research papers on **Affordance perception**.

> As robots(Embodied Agents) are increasingly integrated into real-world applications, their ability to manipulate objects is increasingly in demand, and affordance describes where and how to interact with objects.

This list spans across:
- 2D Affordance Perception
- 3D Affordance Perception
- Affordance Reasoning
- Affordance based Grasping & Manipulatation
Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, this is your go-to hub for exploring Embodied perception.
